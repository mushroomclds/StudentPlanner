# StudentPlanner
Student Planner is a project for my Data Science class that navigates through blackboard to extract assignment and group data, including due dates and assignment names, and brings that into a Kivy GUI that displays all information. Project also utilizes google calendar API to add these assignments and group meetings to personal calendar for ease of access and reminders.

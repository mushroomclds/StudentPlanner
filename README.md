# StudentPlanner
Student Planner is a project for my Data Science class that navigates through blackboard to extract assignment and group data, including due dates and assignment names, and brings that into a Kivy GUI that displays all information. Project also utilizes google calendar API to add these assignments and group meetings to personal calendar for ease of access and reminders. 

Login to Blackboard through kivy GUI
